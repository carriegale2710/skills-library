# Cover letter

A cover letter complements the resume. It answers can you do the job, will you do the job, and will you fit in. It is the main place to show motivation - why this company, why this role - which is often what decides who gets an interview.

Inputs: `criteria.md`, `research.md`, `resume.md`, `resume/master-resume.md`, `resume/stories.md`.
Outputs: `cover-letter.md` (format below, ready for `docx-export`) and `email.md`.

## 1. Pick the letter type

Use the `Letter type` in `criteria.md`.

| Type | When | Subject line |
|---|---|---|
| job-ad | Responding to an advertised role | `Re: <Position> – <Company>` plus `(Ref: <ref>)` if given |
| speculative | No ad and no prior contact | None |
| follow-up | They asked you to send a resume after a conversation | `Re: <Company> <opportunity>` |
| referral | Someone referred you | Optional |

## 2. Pick the opening

- **job-ad:** use a *motivational opening* when `research.md` has a strong hook that connects to the user. Otherwise use a *key selling points opening*: qualification, strongest experience, and why you can succeed in the role.
- Never open with "I am writing to apply for…" or "I am the perfect candidate". Name the role inside a sentence that already says something about you or them.
- **follow-up:** thank them for the conversation and name what impressed you.
- **referral:** name the referrer and their relationship to you in the first sentence.
- **speculative:** give a specific reason you are drawn to them, and acknowledge there may be no advertised role.

## 3. Structure

1. **Opening - why them.** Who you are in one line (qualification plus strongest experience). Why this role and company, using researched specifics. What value you bring to their needs, not what you want.
2. **Middle, 1-3 paragraphs - why you.** Cover the vital 3-5 criteria from `criteria.md`, not every criterion. One theme per paragraph: either one experience that shows several skills, or one skill shown across several experiences. Back each claim with an achievement. For tech roles, name the ad's technologies you have used, and link one relevant repo or project.
3. **Summary.** Why you are the best fit. Try the 3 best things about you and how they will get results in this role.
4. **Closing.** Thank them, and say you look forward to discussing the role at an interview.

## 4. Greeting and sign-off

| Greeting | Sign-off |
|---|---|
| Named contact: `Dear Ms Roberts,` (title and surname, spelled exactly) | `Yours sincerely,` |
| No name found in the ad or research: `Dear Hiring Manager,` | `Yours faithfully,` |

Look for a name first: the ad, `research.md`, then ask the user. Never write "To whom it may concern".

## 5. Rules

- One page: about 300-400 words. No paragraph longer than 6 lines.
- Write like a sales pitch, not an essay. State benefits; skip long explanations.
- No fillers such as "Most recently", "In addition to those skills mentioned previously" or "However".
- Never apologise or hedge. No "while I don't have…" or "although I have limited experience…". Describe what you do have, with enthusiasm.
- Do not say the resume is attached.
- No salary unless the ad asks. Then say it is negotiable and you are happy to discuss it at interview.
- Do not quote the company website. Show you understand what a fact means for them.
- Spell out uncommon acronyms. No SMS abbreviations.
- Never reuse a letter by swapping the company name. Similar roles can share structure, but motivation and evidence must be specific to each.
